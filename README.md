# Sequences-as-Code

Repository for SaC (Sequences as Code)

## Purpose

The purpose of Sequences As Code (SaC) is to:

- Provide a quick and efficient means of creating guided learning paths in the form of sequences.

- Enable sequences to be created and managed in the form of code in GitHub.

- Give SME's a means of creating interactive, embedded hyperlinks, sequences and thus to take a task / process based approach to training people

- Facilitate the development of training which is, as per the recommendations of the Learning Pyramid, more participatory in nature.

- Enable SME's to encapsulate their knowledge together with information from a wide variety of sources and formats in a manner that is readily consumable.

Potential use cases include:

- Work instructions.

- Troubleshooting guides.

- Onboarding activities.

- Inner sourcing engagement models.

- Documenting workflows or commonly repeated tasks.

These use cases support the concept of the learning pyramid based on work from the [National Training Laboratories Institute](https://www.ntl.org/) which suggests that some forms of learning lead to better learning experiences and thus better retention outcomes than others.
